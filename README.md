# Boggle
It's Boggle, but in the command line.

When solving the Boggle board, a thread is made for each of the dice in the board, recursively searching for every word in the board.
`boggle_thread_cursor_asciinema` is an asciinema recording of a Boggle board being solved (showing every half second) that has the output of `solution_PRIHTNFTHALECEMCNESERONZI.txt`.
